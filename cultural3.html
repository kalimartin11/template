			<h1>Paragraph 3</h1>
			<p>Because of this new-found accepted cultural obsession, women are now being treated as objects, again. Relationships are not as important as they were in the past. Often times, a male and female will spend one night together then move to the next partner. What happened to having a crush, going on a date, getting to know each other, and seeing what happens from there? So many women have lost confidence in themselves. They are now looked at as objects and pieces of meat to be used and spit out. Too often, men only look to the physical appearance of women. In the song, “Blurred Lines” Robin Thicke adds to the theme of treating women as animals! His lyrics say “tried to domesticate you, but you're an animal, baby, it's in your nature. Just let me liberate you.” He obviously has no respect for the women in his life and this is clear because of his terminology. He says he tries to domesticate women, which is in every way, disrespectful. A real lady is a work of art and by no means an animal. Saying someone is an animal is just as bad as saying they are not important in the world and belong in the level of the untamed, the wild, the unintelligent. In the music video, women are prancing around in pieces of plastic. Eventually, the girls are wearing no clothing. This message is telling the world that sexy and getting naked is the only way to a man’s heart, the only way to get noticed, and get his respect. This is completely false. Thanks goodness, many people in the world still support a better way.</p>
