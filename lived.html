		<h1>Pack It Up</h1>
		<p>When most people go to the grocery store they look for food, buy it and leave. 
I guess I am among the few percent of people in the world that like going to the store for a new adventure and for many interesting findings. You see every time I step 
down a new aisle there is a new sight to be seen. No, I’m not talking about Wal-Mart folk that are not dressed to impress, but I am talking about each individual, colorful 
and eye catching package that holds all of the food. Ideas for new packaging designs constantly burst through my head. I am always trying to think of ways to draw the eye 
straight to a certain product. I’ll be walking down the aisle thinking, “what a stupid design, why did they make it that way, and why didn’t they do this instead?” Sometimes 
this is a curse because I have a hard time darting through any store in a speedy manor. I guess I was always destined to become a packager. </p>
		<p>High school was most certainly the moment where I knew exactly what I wanted to do with my life. As a photo editor on my school magazine, I had the skill to make info. graphics 
and edit photography.  The computers available to us were not in the best shape, but were still in working order. I was taught how to use InDesign, Photoshop, and Lightroom. 
InDesign allowed me to create graphics from scratch, to teach the reader more about the story. Computers were defiantly a piece of technology that kept me headed toward some 
sort of design career. They have always played a large role in my life and I have always lived around them. My father sells software for IBM, so I am continuously learning more 
and more each day. Although there were some days where I wanted to cut off my ears and punch myself because he loves to inform me of new computer ideas and products for hours at
 a time, he did have a lot to do with my love of computers. There are a wide range of programs on the computer that packaging students and workers use in everyday life. For example, 
CAD is a very popular among the design world. I knew that I wanted to become part of the actual design part of the packaging world because of my background in using computer programs
 such as InDesign. However, I didn’t always know that packaging was an actual job needed in the world.</p>
		<p>After already being interested in design, I attended a career day for Industrial Designers because I had never heard of this in the past. Our speaker was
 extremely informative.  I was able to lay on eyes a ton of sketches, ideas, and actual produced products. He also told us a little about the CAD program that is used to make
 prototypes and initial designs before they are sent out for production. After hearing him talk about that, my ears perked up and I latched on to every word he provided for us. 
All of this blew my mind and I became hooked immediately. Hearing about this advanced level of technology from the computer made me so excited about the Industrial Design world!</p>
		<p>I knew that Michigan State was the school for me, but I still wasn’t sure of a career path that they could offer for me. Michigan State has an enormous 
amount of majors offered to their students. I was completely overwhelmed during my search. Then a huge bright light bulb went off in my head. I remembered that industrial 
design had been my interest. I began the long process of exploring majors. I searched and searched page after page of the green words running across my computer screen. 
It was a process that I will never forget. When I reached the very bottom of the Michigan State list of majors, my heart sank. My dream college did not have the program 
in which I wanted to study so badly. I was crushed. What was I supposed to do now, find another school? No, it was too late to start looking at other schools. Thankfully my 
mom is good at keeping me calm and told me to look at the programs they offered that had to do with design.  I began the treacherous search all over again. As I scrolled through 
the computer screen I came upon a major called Packaging. I had no clue what kind of work was done with packaging. I researched it on Google and came to find out a lot of 
interesting detail. Packaging sounded exactly what I wanted to do with my life. I became revived in my search for a major. With a grin on my face, I found that packaging encompasses 
business, marketing, design, and much more. This field of work is very unique in the world, but very much needed in the everyday life.  Without packagers we wouldn’t have safe 
packages for our products and we wouldn’t have good protection for delicate items when shipping them long distances across the world. </p>
		<p>I have had a great amount of time to search for the major and career of my dreams and thankfully I had some help along the way. Because of this I was 
able to stay calm, cool, and collected. I am extremely excited to explore this world of packaging and someday create my own product. I will let my creative juices flow yet 
still think logically about what consumers are asking for in their household items. The computer has become a huge role in the process of finding what I love to do.  As a 
packager, I will be able to work with foods, beverages, cosmetics, computers, consumer goods, and so much more. Sitting in class and taking notes all day is very boring now, 
but I know it will be worth it when I’m out in the real world working on new designs. I can already picture myself sitting at a computer working on an amazing product that will 
change the world.  Someday I will have produced a product and it will be sitting on a shelf waiting for the world to buy. That moment will be over the top rewarding and worth every
 second of hard work. </p>
