			<h1>Paragraph 5</h1>
			<p>Now the question is what can be done about all of the scandalous work that has already been done? There is a law in each state that says indecency is a crime which is punishable. For example, Michigan State Law states the following,   “A person shall not knowingly make any open or indecent exposure of his or her person or of the person of another.
(2) A person who violates subsection (1) is guilty of a crime, as follows:
(a) Except as provided in subdivision (b) or (c), the person is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than 1 year, or a fine of not more than $1,000.00, or both.
(b) If the person was fondling his or her genitals, pubic area, buttocks, or, if the person is female, breasts, while violating subsection (1), the person is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than 2 years or a fine of not more than $2,000.00, or both.
(c) If the person was at the time of the violation a sexually delinquent person, the violation is punishable by imprisonment for an indeterminate term, the minimum of which is 1 day and the maximum of which is life.” The law is very clear and direct. Why is it that you have to be dressed decently in public, but when it is on stage or in a video this law doesn’t apply at all? If the indecency law was put in to effect, not only in public, but in performances and all over the internet there would not be near the problem of women being treated so unworthy. It seems obvious that they would have so much more confidence because there would be little or nothing to compare themselves to on the internet or in magazines for that fact.
