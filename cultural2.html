			<h1>Paragraph 2</h1>
			<p>Robin Thicke and Miley Cyrus had quite a show on the 2013 Video Music Awards. It started with Miley “twerking” on the stage dancing or moving sexually to the song “We Can’t Stop”. She came out on stage dressed like a child’s toy and eventually disrobed to very, very little clothing. Toward the end of Robin’s song, Miley was grinding on him. After this show, the video of this performance was viewed by millions of people. It went viral. Even the media was repeatedly airing the mess. When a popular female star is viewed through the eyes of young teenager, the star has great influence on them. It is a shame that so many people were subjected to this because it is just another reason why women are treated so horribly today. The Hollywood influences are mostly to blame for why it has become socially acceptable for women to walk around in extremely skimpy clothing. It isn’t only the style that has changed. It is also their actions and attitudes. This generation has even become obsessed with sexual activities. </p>
