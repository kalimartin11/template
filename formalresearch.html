			<h1>Pack It Up : Paragraph 1</h1>
			<p>There are a lot of people that are against packaging and the materials used in packages. They say it is terrible for the planet and doesn’t decompose. They think the packaging is a waste and shouldn’t be used at all. When in reality, everything has to be packaged. How did the computer that you are using get into your hands? It had to be shipped, protected during the shipment, and reached some sort of store for you to buy. The water bottle that you are drinking out of is packaging in itself. If this package was not created, we would all be drinking out of our hands and we wouldn’t have access to other types of drinks. Packaging is one hundred percent necessary in every way. Packagers work every day to make materials that are healthier for our planet. They are becoming more successful every day.<img src="http://www.airpacksystems.com/img/comparison_chart.gif" alt="chart"> At Michigan State University School of Packaging students are learning how to make products more sustainable. Packaging continues to be a growing industry and will never shut down. A common person wouldn’t think of this industry because they are so use to having containers and boxes in their regular life, but who produced and designed these objects that are used and touched daily?
