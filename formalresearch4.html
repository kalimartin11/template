			<h1>Paragraph 4</h1>
			<p><img src="http://www.technologystudent.com/despro2/pkmat1.htm" alt="Ps">The School of Packaging at Michigan State University is the number one program in United States. In the program you can work toward a Bachelor’s degree, Master’s degree, or PH. D. Jay Slagle, a Senior R&D Manager at Global Cereal Packaging for General Mills received his Bachelor of Science from Michigan State University. He said, “MSU School of Packaging provided a great education and opened opportunities to me that I never imagined possible. Packaging will continue to grow in importance over the foreseeable future.” As a student you have to take multiple classes and labs. The school provides testing stations that replicate on site work from businesses. These labs are very informative. A student will work with plastics, metals, and other materials. They also learn how to use design programs that help them in the real world. Reading, writing, and research is also an extremely big part of learning in the Packaging School. Students have to read in every single course they take whether it is reading instructions, text books, lab experiments, tests, or notes. When you major in packaging there is no getting around that fact that you have to read. Students also have to write frequently. They learn to write papers, reports, lab instructions, and much more. In the “real world” there will be a time where a packager has to write an email to a customer or fellow employee, write a report to fill your boss in on how business is looking, or write up some research information. Research in itself is so important. Students will have a lot of time to research by themselves. They will have to participate in labs to work with materials and use computers to research information about new packaging influences. When one graduates from the Michigan State Packaging program they will be very knowledgeable about the entire world of packaging. By the end of their studies, students will be able to choose a focus. Whether that is distribution packaging, environmental impacts, recycling, etc. No matter what they choose students have to be familiar and have a background in business, engineering, and science. For example packaging majors have to pass an advertising class, accounting class, economics class, and many science courses. A well rounded background tends to work better for packaging students. Communication is also extremely important. Packaging majors are required to take writing classes to aid in this area. </p>
