		<h1>Course Retrospective Project </h1>
		<p>Overall this writing, science and technology class has taught me quite a bit. I have learned how to write better, write code, and create a video. These are for sure skills that will come in handy in future internships and full –time positions. The papers that were assigned for us to write were well rounded and each used a different set of skills. The four projects were, Lived Experiences, Cultural Analysis, Formal Research, and Multimedia Remix. The first project was very straight forward. It was easy to write about because it was about technology that had been used in the past to find the career in which we are majoring in today. For example, I used Photoshop technologies to find that I would like to do the designing for packages. When the class turned in their rough drafts for our papers, we all got the same type of feedback. We were used to writing on a high school level, so we had our paper written in essay form. We were given individual feedback and went to fix our papers. We were told to write more like a narrative and to present a story. I thought it was hard to transition from high school writing to college writing because I am not a great writer. In the end I think I did pretty well with this paper, under the circumstances. </p>
		<p>The second paper, Cultural Analysis, was also not bad to write about because we were told we could choose any social issue. Being a college student, there are social issues everywhere around us. I picked the objectification of women because that is a very hot topic which is talked about very often. It is pretty easy to find ideas for this project because the internet has so much gossip and stories.  No matter which social issue you pick, it is pretty easy to elaborate on that topic. I thought the paper was going to be super easy to write, and I might have been if I hadn’t been sick with an ear infection. This taught me to not procrastinate when writing my papers because you never know what will happen along the way. I think I could have written better if the sickness hadn’t taken over my body.</p>
		<p>The Formal Research Paper, the third assignment, was a downright pain to write. It wasn’t necessarily hard to write, it was just very timely because of the extra research that went in to the articles. As a student of this class we had to find two different types of articles and analysis them. We then used this information to back up our topics for our papers. I didn’t understand exactly how to use these analyses to support my paper. I for sure need some more practice putting articles into my research papers. During the formal research project you need to write about your major, again. Another requirement was to interview two different people in the field in which you are studying. It was nice to learn more about my major. No matter what your major is, it is a great idea for you to complete the interview part of the assignment. Networking is a very important skill that will be used in any field of study. This class is very useful because it teaches you how to network for the future. It was also very interesting to hear the views of professionals. </p>
		<p>The last assignment is very interesting. You get to work in a group to create a video documentary about a past project which was already completed. I did not know how to make a video before this assignment. Again, this is a great skill to hold onto for the future. It was also helpful because of the group aspect. In groups you can “play off” of each other. Your ideas combine and become something greater than the original idea. Also, because I didn’t know how to make a professional video, I was able to work with someone that had a lot of experience making videos every day. Just from watching her use the software I was able to learn a lot. That just shows you that learn isn’t always hands-on, it is sometimes easier to watch and learn. This collaboration is an advantage and can give you confidence in your final piece of work. It is fun to get to present your work in a different way, other than just a formal paper.  </p>
		<p>Along the time period of this class you will need to keep up on blogs. Blogs are small writings in which you can reflect on any work that you have done inside and outside this class. How you feel about the work, if it helped you learning anything new, if it taught you about your timeline, etc. I recommend that you do not wait till last second to write out all of your blogs. It is very time consuming if they are all completed at one period of time. It is easier and takes less of your time if you finish a small piece of a writing more often. From experience, it is a pain to try to remember how I felt about a certain project or in class assignment that happened so long ago. Although, I liked that we had some room to pick a topic in class to write on. It may seem, in the beginning, boring to write about only things happening in the class but you will learn to like it. A lot of my blogs were from in-class project, which were fun to write about. We looked at different videos during class and analyzed them. For example, we watched the social network, watched a documentary, watched commercials, and all sorts of other videos. It was a great change of pace when we don’t always have to only be writing papers. Overall, I have learned a great amount of skill from this writing class. I recommend that everyone takes this course. If you are enrolled, make sure you keep up on everything needed for this class. There will be a lot of little information at the end, but the end result will not be regret.  </p>
