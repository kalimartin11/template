They could work with plastics, tin, aluminum, paper, paperboard, film, glass, word, or other materials. Plastics are often times used for buckets, bottles, plastic bags, consumer products, etc. There are many different types of plastic and uses for those plastics. Aluminum is often used for cans, screw tops, and aerosols. For example, spray cheese, Coke cans, soup cans, etc. It can also be used in flexible packaging because it has outstanding barriers. Paper and paperboard can be used for an extreme amount of products. Boxes for cereal, snacks, drink cartons, etc. This is popular to use as a material because it is light weight and not very expensive. Wood is often more expensive because it is coming from trees and there are only so many trees in the world. Expensive items are often packaged in wood to show that it is a quality item and is worth the money. Glass is also a material that tends to be more expensive. This is because it shows well and takes more work to ship. There are so many parts and a lot of research that go into each of these materials. The Michigan State School of Packaging is a wonderful place to learn the details of very material. All of this knowledge doesn’t just come with ease. It takes schooling and research to figure out what works well. </p>
