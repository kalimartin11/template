			<p><img src="http://www.pasadis.com/steve/photos/bottle_2.jpg " alt="bottle">Technology makes it so much easier to communicate. There are multiple programs today that make the packaging world a little easier. Packaging students learn all about these programs while in school. The more complicated software could be C.A.D. This program works with design as well as the program called “Solid Works.” C.A.D. stands for computer aided design. All packaging designers use this program to see the initial design of a bottle, for example. This is also used to design labels, the color design for products, and much more. The article Impacts of CAD on Design Realization says, “The complete and accurate realization of design intent is critical for construction product success.” This article is explaining the importance of designers seeing the product virtually before going through the trouble of production. Some more obvious technology used is again, cell phones, video presentations or communication, emails, instant messaging, Microsoft word, excel, etc.  But not all technology used is from the computer. The hands-on technology is extremely important for packagers to use.  Testing centers allow the products to be tested for the environments they will be shipped into and where they will be siting for long periods of time. Many times during a vibration test or drop test, the product is ruined. If this is the case the designers go back to the drawing board to change materials or angles. After this is fixed the product is good to be sold. Field instrumentation is also used to keep track of data during the tests. Packagers will analyze the data to see how they can improve of the product. </p>
