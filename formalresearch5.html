			<h1>Paragraph 5</h1>
			<p>Every job includes communication, whether it is verbal or written. College packaging students are prepared for frequent communication in the real world. Both Paul Koning and Jay Slagle used phones, emails, text, instant messaging, power point presentations, social media, video, meetings, and most importantly face-to-face communication to keep close contact with coworkers and/or customers. During a job there will be many times when a report is needed to update the boss on how business and projects are coming along. Without communication there would be no business. It is especially important for packaging because multiple people touch the product that is being made. If one part of the production line gets the wrong plan or instructions the entire product could be useless. Therefore, the company loses millions of dollars. When a new product becomes an idea for production it is most likely a team project. The plans of the project are seen by multiple people and talked about to make sure each individual material, for example, is used to the fullest potential. Paul Koning said his favorite job that he had in the past was working for Apple. This is because Apple always works in teams and he loved working in teams because he could get feedback from so many different intelligent and creative minds. The most successful products are created in groups. Communication is very important. Jay Slagle said, “Communication is important because it allows us to advance ideas and solutions that enable us to best deliver solutions that bring benefit to the business that we support.  Time must be taken to ensure that the meaning is fully understood to avoid confusion and mistakes.  Follow up messages to reinforce what was communicated is essential.” Many businesses have routine meetings to make sure everyone is on track.  These meeting include face-to-face communication as well as visual by using power point presentations, etc. Communication is key in any business environment.  </p>
