			<h1>about me</h1>
			<p>The purpose of the video was to inform the audience that the death of his Uncle was not necessary and that life gets better.</p>
<p>The video attempts to achieve the purpose by adding emotion throughout. He starts with a poem that makes the audience interested in what and why he is speaking.
 Then he gets to the point. The speaker tells the story of his gay uncle, while he is emotional. The audience can appeal to the emotion and stay engaged.<p/> 
<p>The structure of the message was kind of difficult to follow. The beginning of the video was a piece to read. 
Next, the speaker began talking to us through poem and then told us a story.</p> 
<p>This video will help me review my narrative by speaking more from my heart. I learned that we have to write more like a story structure and less like an essay.</p>
