			<p> 1. First In-Class Video </P> <p>The purpose of the video was to inform the audience that the death of his Uncle was not necessary and that life gets better. The video attempts to achieve the purpose by adding emotion throughout. He starts with a poem that makes the audience interested in what and why he is speaking.Then he gets to the point. The speaker tells the story of his gay uncle, while he is emotional. The audience can appeal to the emotion and stay engaged.The structure of the message was kind of difficult to follow. The beginning of the video was a piece to read. Next, the speaker began talking to us through poem and then told us a story.This video will help me review my narrative by speaking more from my heart. I learned that we have to write more like a story structure and less like an essay.</p>
			<p> 2. Lived Experiences </p> <p> I am not the type of person that likes to write papers and essays. Although I hate writing, it was not terrible to write about what brought me about the career that I am choosing. The lived experience project took a while for me to write because I didn’t directly have a piece of technology that led me to Packaging. A lot of people don’t know about packaging, but I was lucky enough to hear about it from word of mouth. Although it was hard to choose a piece of technology, I took the obvious choice, the computer. It was not a direct reason why I decided to be a packaging engineer, but I did research the business quite a bit online. The lived experiences paper helped me relive the reason why I’m going to love my career. </P>
			<p> 3.The Social Network </p><p>I have noticed that everyone these days have lost focus on writing and the proper way to write. Facebook and other social sites are leading to the lack of proper grammar. Although social networks do make it easier to talk and keep in contact with people, we tend to use slang and shorten our words. I fell into the same trap with the “help” of Facebook, Twitter, and texting. My papers for school were becoming hard to write because I kept using slang words instead of the correct word. I have decided to make myself type out the entire word when I am texting to get in a good habit of writing correctly.</P>
			<p> 4.The Cultural Proposal  </p><p> The cultural proposal was an exciting paper to write about because I was able to have an opinion and convince the audience. It was also easy to write this because I am very passionate about the topic that I choose. It was very easy to think of reasons why to support my opinion, but it was hard for me to put the entire paper together because I was very sick during the writing time. Sometimes it is hard to add transitions into my paper. I need more practice with that for sure. My topic was about women being degraded. I think this topic is in our world every day. Some people agree with me, but some do not. Hopefully my paper convinced the audience. </P>
			<p> 5.Library Activity </p><p>I did not like the library activity at all. I didn’t get a lot of the assignment. Although I did learn that the Michigan State University Library website is very confusing and is not easy to work with. The idea of the website is a great idea. It is also a good idea to present the idea of the library website to the students that aren’t familiar with the site. I wish that the website was reworked and refinished though. I think that this activity could have been a lot more affective if we went through the website as a class first. In the need I didn’t really understand why this assignment was assigned.  </P>
			<p> 6.The Formal Research </p><p>The formal research project was an interesting paper to write. It was nice to explore my major a little more. I really enjoyed interviewing people that worked in the packaging world because packaging is all about networking and knowing people because it is such a tight, small industry. Although I did enjoy interviews, I did not like doing research in the articles. I found that the library website was hard to use and my searches were either too specific or not specific enough. Sometimes I like research projects but as a whole I did not like this assignment. </P>
			<p> 7.Interviews </p><p>Getting the interviews for my formal research project was very enjoyable. I interviewed a Packaging professor and a man that works in the packaging field. It was so nice to get the insight of actual packagers. Someday I will be in their shoes and I will be doing exactly what they are doing now or have done in the past. I liked learning of experiences they have had. It is very important to network with people in the packaging world because packaging is such a closely knit industry, everyone knows everyone. But that goes for any industry. It is always good for anyone to network. Because of doing this first interview I would not be afraid to do another interview. This experience has helped me to spread my horizons and break out of my shell.  </P>
			<p> 8.Chrysler Commercial </p><p>The Chrysler commercial with Eminem, which was shot in Detroit, was a very successful commercial.  They used many technics to draw the audience in, in order to sell a car. They used the strategy of using a famous person. They did this so the audience would think “Eminem likes this kind of car so I should go buy it too.” They filmed the commercial in Detroit which is known to be the motor city where all cars were originally made. A third strategy is using one of Eminem’s songs. They had a double threat by using not only Eminem, but also his music. His music is extremely popular. When a costumer views the commercial they will think of the popular song playing in the background. When the song plays in other areas, they audience will most likely think of the commercial. There were many more strategies used such as everything looking luxurious and nice, but these three are very obvious.  </P>
			<p> 9.Reviewing Commercials </p><p>It was very interesting to watch different types of commercials. Usually I watch commercials and don’t really pay attention because that is not the reason I want to watch TV. Now I had the chance to analyze each commercial and see why they used certain colors, music, and people to bring a point to the audience. The BP commercial stood out to me quite a bit because of the animation. They used babies as the main characters and used very bright colors to grab your attention and focus on a “green” company. They used a lot of green and white colors to do this. The commercial was very well displayed and interesting to analyze.   </P>
			<p> 10.Documentary Worksheet </p><p>This in class assignment was very different from the rest. At first I had no clue why we were answering questions about a weird Documentary about Aliens and I thought my professor was just using the assignment as a space filer. After answering some questions I realized why we were analyzing this piece of work. This was practice to analyze other types of literacy. We were able to look at the show from a different perspective. I answered questions that were asking about the content and how everything connected. This assignment ended up not being that bad.  </P>
			<p> 11.Remix Proposal  </p><p>This assignment took a lot time to complete. The idea for the proposal was to get our thoughts in order to make our remix video project. I personally thought the questions on the proposal sheet were extremely repetitive. My partner and I had to answer so many of the questions the same way. At that point in of creative journey we didn’t know exactly what we were going to put in the video other than of social issue topic. This proposal forced us to get our act together and get focused on what we needed to get done. We then got all of the questions answered and made a plan for the next step in our video. Thank goodness for the proposal.  </P>
			<p> 12.Interview for Remix </p><p> The video was fun and stressful to organize. We needed a plan to go off of to keep us on track. We decided to make a list and write down the order of everything which was going into the video. We also made a list of people we wanted in interview. We made sure to have extra people on the list in case someone didn’t want to speak or didn’t have time to meet with us. Most of our interviews went smoothly, but we for sure did have some technical problems along the way. For example, after I interviewed my dad, I had no way of getting the videos off of the phone and onto the computer. It was a pain and we were not able to use the clips, which was unfortunate. It was a good thing we left enough time to fix and replace interviews and problems. </P>
			<p> 13.Remix Video </p><p> The remix video was very fun to make although it was a long process. My partner knew how to use a good video making software so she did a lot of the hands on work. I wish I was able to help more with the hands on part, but the software was only on her computer. I have to admit it was hard to watch her work for a long period of time because I couldn’t help much, but when we got our plan down it was easy to get down. Thankfully now I don’t only know how to write code, but I also know how to make a video.</P>
			<p> 14.Reviewing Lived Experience Papers </p><p>It was easy to read other student’s papers about the lived experience paper. Everyone’s response to the paper was about the same and some didn’t say anything specific about it at all. I found that most students in the class thought that the Lived Experience paper was a good paper to start with because it is easier to write about yourself than something you know nothing about. I felt the same way. It was also a good project to start with because it gave us a chance to look at our major in a different light.  </P>
			<p> 15.Working with the Lived Experience Group</p><p>The last day of class was the first time I met with my final project group. I found that we worked very well together. There seemed to be two people leading the group, so that worked very well. It is hard to work in a group without some sort of leader. We got our entire group final project finished. It was a nice way to end the semester of class. During the rest of the different classes no one really talked to each other because we were all on our computers and working by ourselves. I think it would have been good to work on a project like this in the beginning so everyone could get to know each other better.</P>
