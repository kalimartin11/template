			<h1>Paragraph 2</h1>
			<p>Packaging is quite a complicated profession to explain. No, packaging is not putting products in boxes to have them be shipped. It is actually working with materials to create sustainable, eye catching, and practical packages. In the packaging world there is a need for multiple skills. A mix of package development, sales, purchasing, structural design, production, research, and marketing are important topics to comprehend as packagers. In the words of Michigan State University’s Packaging Professor, Paul Koning, “Packaging is a system; it is the product and the package coming together as one.” Everything has to have a package at some point during the production process. There are three types of packages, the primary, secondary, and tertiary package. Primary packaging is the package or material that holds the product being sold. For example Coke. Coke is the drink that is being sold when the can is a primary package. Primary packages can be all kinds of materials, plastic, paper, paperboard, aluminum, etc. When multiple Coke cans are packaged together in paperboard containers, this serves as the secondary package. After many packs of Coke are produced they are loaded into boxes or onto pallets to be shipped. The boxes and pallets are used as tertiary packaging. There are large companies that focus on these different types of packages. “Uline” is a company that makes packaging material for example. Although tertiary packing materials are extremely important to packaging, there also has to be a focus on the primary package. When constructing and producing these other packages there are “5 P’s” that re-center a packager’s focus to make the product as functional as possible. They are product, price, packaging, place, and promotion. The product is obviously the object being sold. Price is how much the product is worth including rebates, incentives, or leasing subsides. When the product is in the store environment and sharing an experience that is where packaging comes into play. Packagers want a customer to be drawn in through the design, color, and shape of the package while it is sitting on the shelf. The place is also extremely important in the distribution system. Where you market the product and the store in which it is selling, will influence the success of the item. Last but not least, promotion which is part of the consumer goods industry. Promotion includes positioning, advertising, sales promotion, and public relations. All of these important factors of production used together will equal a successful product. Often times the designer will go back and review the “P’s” to make sure they are doing everything possible to make the product sell. </p>
