			<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
			<p>Once upon a time, women were property. Years and years were spent digging out, talking, protesting and banding together to stand up for their rights as individuals demanding some sort of equality or at the very least, the same respect given men.  It appeared they had made it and slogans like, “You’ve come a long way, baby” were readily heard.  But in our society today, we are growing far from the level of respect we worked so hard to achieve. Women are no longer spoken of highly. Social media has had such a negative influence on the world. Many music videos are getting extremely inappropriate for our world to see. On a regular basis when a female is in the music video they are seen with very little clothing or none at all. It’s no longer even shocking. The innocence of our culture is gone. Robin Thicke's "Blurred Lines" video is just one video that expresses this crud view of women. Throughout the entire video, girls are dancing around in very skimpy clothing and sometimes no clothes at all. When you have popular lyrics that refer to “domesticating women”, it is just ridiculous to think that our mesmerized world won't respond the same way and treat women like animals.</p>
